# desafios-ranking

__desafios-ranking__ is the a competitive programming leaderboard, but it doesn't ranks the competitors, it ranks the _problems_ instead.
This ranking is exclusively to the problems of Unicamp's competitive programming classes, updated at least on a daily basis. The problems are hosted in codepit.io, a online judge (like [UVa](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/)).
